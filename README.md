# write-data [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/write-data.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/write-data) [![NPM monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/write-data.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/write-data) [![Linux Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/write-data.svg?style=flat&label=Travis)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/write-data)

> Write a YAML or JSON file to disk. Automatically detects the format to write based on extension. Or pass `ext` on the options.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save write-data
```

Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
$ yarn add write-data
```

## Usage

Add to your node.js application with the following line of code:

```js
var writeData = require('write-data');

// async
writeData(filepath, data[, options], function(err) {
  // do stuff with "err"
});

// sync
writeData.sync(filepath, data[, options]);
```

## API

The file extension is used to detect the data format to write. This can be overriden by passing a value on `options.ext`.

### YAML examples

```js
var data = {language: 'node_js', node_js: ['0.10', '0.12']};

// async
writeData('.travis.yml', data, function(err) {
  // do stuff with "err"
});

// sync
writeData.sync('.travis.yml', data);
```

Both would write a `.travis.yml` file to disk with the following contents:

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "0.10"
  - "0.12"
```

### JSON examples

```js
var data = { name: 'foo', version: '0.1.0' };

// async
writeData('package.json', data, function(err) {
  // do stuff with "err"
});

// sync
writeData.sync('package.json', data);
```

Both would write a `package.json` file to disk with the following contents:

```json
{ 
  "name": "foo", 
  "version": "0.1.0" 
}
```
